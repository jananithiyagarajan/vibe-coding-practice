## Practical 4: Project: Basic Document Q&A System

### Why (in simple terms)

Now that we have all the pieces—AI, Embeddings, and a Vector Database—let's build a real **RAG System**.

**The Vision**:
You have a 10-page PDF of your company's "Employee Handbook."
- **Without RAG**: You have to read the whole thing to find out about "Vacation Policy."
- **With RAG**: You ask the AI "How many days off do I get?" and it finds the exact page, reads it, and tells you the answer.

**The Solution**:
This is the **"Search-then-Summarize"** pattern:
1. **User asks a question**.
2. **Search** the Vector DB for the most relevant "Knowledge".
3. **Summarize**: Give the AI the question + the knowledge.
4. **Answer**: The AI answers based *only* on that knowledge.

### What you'll build

You'll build a "Smart FAQ Bot" that:
- Stores "Company Policies" in a Mini Vector DB.
- Searches for the right policy based on a user's question.
- Uses Groq AI to generate a helpful answer from that policy.

### Quick start for beginners

**We'll build on the project from Practical 3**

## Step 0: Open your project

1. Open the `rag-basics-practice` folder.
2. Open `server.js` in VS Code.

## Step 1: Create the Smart RAG API

Update `server.js` and paste this complete RAG logic:

```js
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const Groq = require('groq-sdk');
const similarityScore = require('similarity-score');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });

// 1. Our "Company Knowledge" (The Knowledge Base)
const knowledgeBase = [
  "Vacation Policy: Employees get 20 days of paid time off per year.",
  "Work Hours: Standard hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday.",
  "Remote Work: Employees can work from home up to 2 days per week.",
  "Dress Code: Business casual is required from Monday to Thursday. Friday is casual.",
  "Health Benefits: Full health insurance is provided after 3 months of employment."
];

// 2. Simple Search Function (Our "Retriever")
function findRelevantKnowledge(query) {
  const matches = knowledgeBase.map(doc => ({
    text: doc,
    score: similarityScore(query, doc)
  }));
  
  // Sort and pick the best match
  return matches.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0].text;
}

// 3. The RAG Endpoint
app.post('/api/rag/ask', async (req, res) => {
  const { question } = req.body;

  if (!question) return res.status(400).json({ error: "Question is required" });

  try {
    // STEP A: RETRIEVE the relevant knowledge
    const knowledge = findRelevantKnowledge(question);
    console.log(`Found relevant info: "${knowledge}"`);

    // STEP B: GENERATE the answer using AI
    const completion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [
        { 
          role: "system", 
          content: `You are a helpful HR assistant. Use ONLY the following information to answer the user's question. 
                   If the answer is not in the information, say "I'm sorry, I don't have that information."
                   
                   INFORMATION: ${knowledge}` 
        },
        { role: "user", content: question }
      ],
      model: "llama3-8b-8192",
    });

    res.json({
      question: question,
      answer: completion.choices[0].message.content,
      source_used: knowledge
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ RAG Error:", error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to get RAG answer" });
  }
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Smart RAG Bot running on http://localhost:${PORT}`));
```

## Step 2: Run the server

In terminal, type:
```bash
node server.js
```

## Let's test it (easy way)

### Step 3: Ask the Bot

Open a new terminal and try these commands:

**Test 1: A valid question**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rag/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"How many vacation days do I get?"}'
```

**Test 2: A different valid question**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rag/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"Can I work from home?"}'
```

**Test 3: A question outside the knowledge base**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rag/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What is the company lunch budget?"}'
```

**What you're learning:**
- **RETRIEVAL**: Your code found the right policy before the AI even saw the question.
- **AUGMENTATION**: You added that policy to the AI's prompt.
- **GENERATION**: The AI wrote a nice answer using *only* that policy.
- **ACCURACY**: The AI didn't "guess" about the lunch budget; it admitted it didn't know.

---

### ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] `POST /api/rag/ask` endpoint added.
- [ ] AI answers correctly based on the `knowledgeBase`.
- [ ] AI refuses to answer questions not in the `knowledgeBase`.
- [ ] You understand: **RAG** = Search (Retreival) + Summarize (Generation).

### 🆘 Common Problems

**Problem**: "AI still guesses the answer"
- **Fix**: Make your System Prompt stricter: "Use ONLY the information provided. Do NOT use your own knowledge."

**Problem**: "Wrong policy retrieved"
- **Fix**: Simple keyword matching can fail. Real RAG uses **Embeddings** (Module 10.2) to find the right meaning.

## 🎨 Lovable AI Prompt (copy/paste this)

```text
Build a "Smart HR Support Bot" UI.

Requirements:
- A chat interface: "Ask me about company policies...".
- When I ask a question, show a "Searching Handbook..." animation.
- Display the AI response in a "Support Agent" bubble.
- Under the response, show a "Source" tag: "Answered using: Vacation Policy".
- A "Handbooks" section showing all the policies the bot "knows".
- Use a "Professional Office" theme (blues, greys, clean typography).
- Add a "Feedback" thumb up/down for each answer.

Make it look like a real corporate HR portal!
```
